## Objectives
* Make associations for multiple models
* ActiveRecord
* form_for / form_tag / form_helpers

### The Domain
You've been hired as a barista at a cafe and want to improve their point of sales system!
You see so many customers throughout the day, but want to know which customers are regulars, and track their purchases.

* A `customer` has_many `purchases`
* A `brew` has_many `purchases`
* A `purchase` belongs_to a `customer` and to a `brew`
* A `customer` has_many `brews` through `purchases`
* A `brew` has_many `customers` through `purchases`

### Already Completed
* `rails new brew-crew`
* `rails g model Brew blend_name:string origin:string notes:string strength:integer`
* added 'faker' gem to Gemfile
* `rails g model Customer name`
* `rails g model Purchase brew_id:integer customer_id:integer`
* Created seed data

### Setup
* Fork and clone the repo
* In terminal, run `bundle install`
* In terminal, run `rake db:migrate`

##### Deliverables
* Create the associations between the models, then run `rake db:seed`, check that Brews have been made in the rails console
* As the user, when I go to the brews index page, it should display all of the brews as links to their show page.
* As the user, the brew show page should have the brews name, origin, notes, and strength
* As the user, the customer show page should display their name and list all of the brews they've purchased
* As the user, I should be able to create a new purchase (with a collection_select for Brew.all) and a field for a customer's name (how would I be able to take in a new Customer if I wasn't already found?)

#### Bonus
* Create a validation so a Customer's name must be unique
* Create a new page for creating a brew and give it a form for all the fields necessary for a brew
* Create validations so the fields cannot be empty
* Create validations so that the strength of a brew must be between `1` to `5`
